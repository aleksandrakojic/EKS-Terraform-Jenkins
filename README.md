# AWS EKS cluster using Terraform & Jenkins

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS. Using AWS EKS we can run Kubernetes without installing and operating a Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes. 
AWS EKS provides highly available and secure clusters and automates key tasks such as patching, node provisioning, and updates.
